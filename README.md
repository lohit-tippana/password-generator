# 🔐 Password Generator

A simple Python-based password generator that creates secure and customizable passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.

## 🚀 Features

- User-defined length of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Randomized order for added security
- Simple command-line interface (CLI)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program asks the user how many:
   - Letters (uppercase and lowercase)
   - Numbers (0–9)
   - Symbols (!, @, #, etc.)
2. It randomly selects characters based on the user’s input.
3. Shuffles the characters for randomness.
4. Outputs a strong password.
